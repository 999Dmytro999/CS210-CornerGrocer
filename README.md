# CS210-CornerGrocer

Summary
The Corner Grocer project analyzes grocery store transactions and tracks the frequency of each item purchased throughout the day. The goal was to help the store better understand customer purchasing patterns and optimize the store layout for maximum efficiency. The program reads a text file containing purchased items, counts how many times each appears, and outputs this information both numerically and visually as a histogram.

What I Did Well
I designed a clean and functional menu-based program with clear options, user input validation, and accurate output formatting. The program correctly handles invalid input, reads and processes data efficiently, and outputs results in a readable and user-friendly format. The histogram visualization works smoothly and displays accurate frequencies.

Possible Enhancements
I could improve the code by allowing case-insensitive item searches and by adding error handling for missing input files. These improvements would make the program more robust and user-friendly. Additionally, storing data in a database instead of a text file would make it more scalable and efficient for larger datasets.

Challenges and How I Overcame Them
One of the most challenging parts was reading and parsing the input file while maintaining accurate item frequency counts. I overcame this by using C++ maps, which automatically handle key-value pairs efficiently. Debugging linker and build issues in VS Code was another challenge, which I solved by configuring MinGW correctly and rebuilding the project from a clean directory.

Transferable Skills
This project strengthened my skills in C++ programming, file input/output, data structures (especially maps), and code organization using classes. These are highly transferable to other software development projects, especially those involving data analysis, backend development, or performance optimization.

Maintainability and Readability
The program is written with consistent indentation, clear naming conventions, and descriptive comments. The logic is separated into functions and a class, making the code modular and easy to extend. Anyone reviewing the code can quickly understand and modify it if needed.
